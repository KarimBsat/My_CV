    <h3>Store Management System using Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p><i>Build a fully functional store management system using the key features of Object-Oriented Programming.</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Main coding language used: C++.</li>
        <li>Utilized the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, namely Classes, Objects, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction and Encapsulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3D Modeling of a Washing Machine Drain Pump Cover</h3>
    <p><i>Utilized my skills in AutoDESK 360Fusion to design a replacement for a pump cover, which was then 3D printed for use.</i></p>
    <h3>Design and Code an Autonomous 3KG SUMO Robot</h3>
    <p><i>Worked with a team to design, build, and program, via Arduino Microcontroller, an effective robot able to autonomously identify and bulldoze other robots in a “Sumo” competition.</i></p>
